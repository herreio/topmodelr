Description: For model creation the latent Dirichlet allocation and the
    biterm topic model via R libraries topicmodels and BTM are used
    with Gibbs Sampling as inference method. After infering the models,
    the similarity of the documents is determined with regard to their
    topic distributions via the R interface to the approximate nearest
    neighbor library Annoy. The measurement of the title similarity by
    topics can be used to retrieve the top n most similar titles to a
    given document.
