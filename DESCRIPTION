Title: Topic Modeling in R (LDA, BTM)

    person(given = "Donatus",

Description: For model creation the latent Dirichlet allocation and the
    biterm topic model via R libraries topicmodels and BTM are used with
    Gibbs Sampling as inference method. After infering the models, the
    similarity of the documents can be determined with regard to their
    topic distributions via the R interface to the approximate nearest
    neighbor library Annoy. The measurement of the document similarity by
    topics can be used to retrieve the top n most similar documents to a
    given document.
